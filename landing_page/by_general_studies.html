In a warm and nurturing

environment that values

individual effort and achievement

as much as academic excellence,

Bnos Yaakov challenges students

to think critically, explore,

take risks and exceed their

own expectations.

Our enriched General Studies

program emphasizes the

development of fundamental

academic skills, complementing

stimulating classroom instruction

with innovative hands-on projects

and activities that encourage

curricular integration and

life application.

A variety of innovative methods

- including dynamic lectures,

collaborative learning, Q&A

(inquiry-based learning) and

interdisciplinary instruction -

ensure that students acquire core

understanding of the subject

matter and the problem solving

and critical thinking skills they will

utilize throughout their lives.</p>

Classes are conducted to encourage maximum student to student discussion. Students hone their writing and analytical skills and are required to write a research paper employing a comparative approach at the end of the sophomore or junior year. All courses stress the importance of cogent writing, critical thinking and the analysis of concepts. Mastery of factual material and the ability to discuss and debate the events that have shaped and are shaping the modern world and the Jewish nation are also emphasized.</p>

                           Scientific understanding and knowledge of the physical and biological principles of the way the world operates have become increasingly important. Members of society who understand the complexities and interrelationships of the scientific disciplines can make intelligent use of this knowledge to improve the human condition. Nutrition and general healthy lifestyle habits will be emphasized throughout the four school years. Physics, biology, and chemistry will be taught through a variety of teaching styles such as lecture, group work, lab study, computer simulations and end of term projects.

Girls are taught how to write essays, short stories, plays, poetry, humorous pieces, children’s books, historical fiction, persuasive essays, op-ed articles, term papers, as well as research papers. Girls learn and practice in class – under the teacher’s supervision – how to brainstorm, write, revise, rewrite, edit and publish. In depth application of grammar, vocabulary and editing skills in writing is stressed. Girls complete each grade with a portfolio of her best work. Upon graduating, students will have learned how to express themselves with clarity and ease in personal, expository and creative writing.

Students are required to take two years of math. Algebra and Geometry give students the tools to analyze and explore mathematical  patterns found within our daily experiences.  Courses focus on understanding math as both a language and a logic system, and there is an emphasis on the application of mathematical principles to the solutions of real life problems. Technological applications, such as Geometer’s Sketchpad and calculator-based graphing, serve to deepen our students’ understanding of sophisticated mathematical concepts. An optional year of advanced algebra and trigonometry will further prepare students for the SAT exams, as well as for Calculus and college level mathematics. Alternatively, accounting will prepare students to enter the workforce with useful and valued skills.

Since our society has become increasingly dependent on the flow of information utilizing technology, students must demonstrate skill in computing in order to graduate. They meet this requirement by taking and passing two out of four years of computer science. The curriculum will include instruction in several important applications, such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Adobe Photoshop. In addition, teachers from other departments will integrate their course work with that of the computer class, giving the students several opportunities to use their computing skills in a practical manner.
