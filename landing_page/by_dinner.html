                                    I walk into school with a feeling of excitement </br>
                                    “Excitement?! You wonder </br>
                                    Yes that’s it! </br>
                                    As I pass the classrooms and hear the chatter, I can’t help but smile </br>
                                    I already feel excited just glancing at the happy faces </br>
                                    I head to the davening room, knowing today is another day of school </br>
                                    And another day of happiness </br>
                                    More learning and more friendship </br>
                                    I’m only in school for ten minutes, and I already know today is  going to be another wonderful day at Bnos Yaakov

                                <p class="text">
                                    People say our school under the ground is like a bomb shelter.  So secluded that even the day’s weather eludes us until      we step outside.  They all say this as a negative thing.  I see the shelter analogy differently.  Bnos Yaakov really is a shelter.              It’s a place where we retreat to prepare ourselves for the war     above. In it, we train like soldiers every single day, because we        are soldiers- soldiers of Hashem. </br>                                   
                                    And there is a war , it’s called Galus.  At Bnos Yaakov          we learn how to fight and survive  a world  full of immorality and influence.  When we do emerge -not at the end of the day, but           after four years-we are ready. We are model soldiers.                Campaigning, fighting, and aiding in the win of this three thousand year war.  Our eventual victory will be all thanks to this little shelter under the ground!

                                <h4>Too Great for Words</h4>
                                <p class="text">
                                    It seems almost like an impossible task to try to name everything Bnos Yaakov has given me in the past two and a half years.  The inspiring lessons from our wonderful principals and teachers, the sight of girls laughing and talking in the hallways     each morning, and the feeling of unity as the school dances by chagiga…. It’s a feeling that is truly difficult to put on paper.          The greatest things in life can only be understood and appreciated    by actually experiencing them, and Bnos Yaakov is one of them. </br>
                                    One aspect of our school that stands out to me is the inspirational guest speakers we are privileged to hear quite often.  One particular speaker that made an impact on my life is Rabbi Milstein, who came to speak at last year’s Shabbaton.  He spoke about what it means to be happy with our lives by changing our view of the world.  Rabbi Milstein told a story about a woman       who was miserable with her life circumstances, to the point that     she no longer wanted to continue living.  Rabbi Milstein told us        to imagine that the woman was blind, in addition to all the other problems that she was experiencing.  What if she could get her sight back?  Wouldn’t she be the happiest woman in the world?  We can all be the happiest people, if we learn to appreciate all the gifts we have been given.  When Rabbi Milstein spoke about this, it made    me realize how many things there are in my life that I never took    the time to think about.  This is just one of the experiences in Bnos Yaakov that changed my life for the better, and I feel very lucky that I still have time to gain from the many gifts my school has to offer.

                                <h4>Worth It</h4>
                                <p class="text">
                                    Imagine a small blue pebble among fields of blue pebbles.   As time goes by, the pebbles get blown, thrown, or kicked away;  and before you it the small pebble is in a completely new place.       As the blue pebble moves slowly with the wind a loud whipping sound is heard, and remarkably, all the original blue pebbles are moving with the small pebble alongside the wind. </br>
                                    What is high school? </br>
                                    As much as I’d like to say it’s getting up at seven to spend eight hours taking notes, tests and quizzes, I can’t.  Because in Bnos Yaakov, I’ve learnt that it’s so much more.  It’s the opportunity to    let ourselves grow and discover who we are, and within that    process we get to make extraordinary friends who’ve become like family, and have our backs throughout the entire journey.  I used     to believe that acing every subject and getting perfect scores is what mattered most, but Boruch Hashem I’m coming to understand that doing well academically is only a part of the big picture.  It’s about being able to look back at the four year experience and seeing the growth and progress we’ve been strong enough to build.  It’s to    look back and remember the inspiring lessons taught by teachers   that gave us one million percent.</br> 
                                    Lastly and most importantly, it’s having and keeping the incredible friendships  that we’ve been fortunate enough to make.    Like the small blue pebble, no matter how far each of our lives takes us, we will always hold on to the love and warmth that we’ve received from Bnos Yaakov, and it will travel alongside us forever.

                                    But many form a bouquet</br>
                                    Beauty on a higher plane.</br>
                                    Here at Bnos Yaakov we are creating</br>
                                    Breathtaking bouquets</br>
                                    Of hundreds of hues</br>
                                    Taking parts</br>

                                    Are colorful, bright papers</br>
                                    Are pieces of hearts and souls and memories</br>
