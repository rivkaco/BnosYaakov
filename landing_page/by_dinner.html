        <p class= "text-poem">
            
I walk into school with a feeling of excitement <br/>
“Excitement?! You wonder <br/>
Yes that’s it! <br/>
As I pass the classrooms and hear the chatter, I can’t help but smile <br/>
I already feel excited just glancing at the happy faces <br/>
I head to the davening room, knowing today is another day of school <br/>
And another day of happiness <br/>
More learning and more friendship <br/>
I’m only in school for ten minutes, and I already know today is  going to be <br/> another wonderful day at Bnos Yaakov <br/>

        <h4 class= "title-poem">Ninth Grade</h4>
        <p class= "text-poem">
            Being a ninth grader <br/>
It’s hard to adjust,<br/>
Trying to figure out<br/>
Whom to trust<br/>
Because making a long lasting friendship<br/>
Is a must.<br/>
The intensity<br/>
Of schoolwork is a challenge<br/>
Depending on others reviews to manage.<br/>
Although it’s tough,<br/>
To say the least,<br/>
There is no harm or damage.<br/>
Because of the environment<br/>
Bnos Yaakov exudes<br/>
From the students there is a sense of<br/>
Warmth, loyalty, safety, authority, and protection<br/>
Did I mention the affection<br/>
Towards each individual?<br/>
That’s why I feel welcome in B.Y.<br/>
There’s always someone who cares about your trouble<br/>
No matter how big or little.

        <h4 class= "title-poem">Growth</h4>
        <p class= "text-poem">
            Just like a wild flower;<br/>
Always spends its days<br/>
Allowing itself to grow<br/>
We must allow ourselves to grow<br/>
In every area.<br/>
A person who has never made a mistake<br/>
Has never tried anything new<br/>
Bnos Yaakov High, taught us that growth is a  great thing<br/>
And they gave us the determination to  grow in everything<br/>
Because the most important thing in life<br/>
Is to stop saying I can’t and start saying I will<br/>
Consider nothing impossible but instead possible<br/>
Which will lead to all kinds of possibilities<br/>

        <h4 class= "title-poem">Warmth</h4>
        <p class= "text-poem">
            I come in from the freezing cold outside<br/>
The rain is falling heavily<br/>
Down a flight of stairs<br/>
Turn two corners<br/>
And enter my classroom<br/>
Then warmth hits me<br/>
It’s the warmth of the principals<br/>
Doors that always open<br/>
The smiles on the girls faces<br/>
The teachers’ inspiring lessons<br/>
The colorful walls and gorgeous bulletin boards<br/>
The pleasant and calm spirit<br/>
This is what warms me on a cold day<br/>

        <h4 class= "title-poem">Those Minutes</h4>
        <p class= "text-poem">
            
The bell rings<br/>
With a sigh<br/>
I return to class<br/>
Forty-five minutes<br/>
And some words later<br/>
The bell rings<br/>

My back straight in my seat<br/>
And thoughts running in my brain<br/>
Those minutes<br/>
Have changed me<br/>
Forever<br/>

        <p class= "text-poem">
            Bnos Yaakov<br/>
A mere four walls<br/>
A steep flight down<br/>
A world of its own<br/>

It’s the same air that we breathe<br/>
Yet there is a disguised spirit<br/>
Pushing us<br/>
To touch the stars <br/>
And reach our potential <br/>

Four years gone by <br/>
A blur of failure, triumph<br/>
Triumph, failure<br/>
My left foot is one step out the door<br/>
Racing to the enticement of <br/>
The Real World<br/>

Yet my right one lingers<br/>
Captured by an unidentified force<br/>
That drags me back down<br/>
That steep flight of stairs<br/>
To what no longer seems<br/>
A mere four walls

        <p class= "text-poem">
           Reb Moshe Feinstein zt”l lived in Russia sned was a brilliant chess        player Yet when he was eight years old, he gave up playing chess                 for learning Torah.  He explained in his later years, “I told myself                  that if one is already using his mind, it would better be used for             Limud Hatorah.”  He made a decision that seemed so tiny, yet it            ultimately shaped his entire life.  Rav Moshe chose to occupy himself             with learning instead of playing chess and he brought endless             kedusha into the world.  He had the ability to change the world                 through himself.

            I stand aside<br/>
As I wait for the bus<br/>
The rowdy chatter of the public school kids<br/>

I stand on the side<br/>
Proud of being<br/>
Different

At times you have credit<br/>
While at others you may be in debt<br/>
So too in Life<br/>
You start empty<br/>
The more effort you put in <br/>
The more dividends you take out<br/>
The more good deeds you do<br/>
The more merits you attain<br/>
While the bad deeds you do <br/>
Cause you downfalls and pain<br/>
So choose to invest in a life<br/>
Which is full of<br/>
Credits, fulfillment and success.

        <p class= "text-poem">
 
Life is like a fruit salad. Some fruits alone are slightly bitter<br/>
and others are sweet, but when mixed together they all<br/> 
complement each other and create a delicious balance of taste, <br/>
texture and colors. Sometimes life seems bitter, other time sour,<br/> 
or honeyed, but when looking at life as a whole, <br/>
it is completely perfect!

                                    I walk into school with a feeling of excitement </br>
                                    “Excitement?! You wonder </br>
                                    Yes that’s it! </br>
                                    As I pass the classrooms and hear the chatter, I can’t help but smile </br>
                                    I already feel excited just glancing at the happy faces </br>
                                    I head to the davening room, knowing today is another day of school </br>
                                    And another day of happiness </br>
                                    More learning and more friendship </br>
                                    I’m only in school for ten minutes, and I already know today is  going to be another wonderful day at Bnos Yaakov

                                <p class="text">
                                    People say our school under the ground is like a bomb shelter.  So secluded that even the day’s weather eludes us until      we step outside.  They all say this as a negative thing.  I see the shelter analogy differently.  Bnos Yaakov really is a shelter.              It’s a place where we retreat to prepare ourselves for the war     above. In it, we train like soldiers every single day, because we        are soldiers- soldiers of Hashem. </br>                                   
                                    And there is a war , it’s called Galus.  At Bnos Yaakov          we learn how to fight and survive  a world  full of immorality and influence.  When we do emerge -not at the end of the day, but           after four years-we are ready. We are model soldiers.                Campaigning, fighting, and aiding in the win of this three thousand year war.  Our eventual victory will be all thanks to this little shelter under the ground!

                                <p class="text">
                                    It seems almost like an impossible task to try to name everything Bnos Yaakov has given me in the past two and a half years.  The inspiring lessons from our wonderful principals and teachers, the sight of girls laughing and talking in the hallways     each morning, and the feeling of unity as the school dances by chagiga…. It’s a feeling that is truly difficult to put on paper.          The greatest things in life can only be understood and appreciated    by actually experiencing them, and Bnos Yaakov is one of them. </br>
                                    One aspect of our school that stands out to me is the inspirational guest speakers we are privileged to hear quite often.  One particular speaker that made an impact on my life is Rabbi Milstein, who came to speak at last year’s Shabbaton.  He spoke about what it means to be happy with our lives by changing our view of the world.  Rabbi Milstein told a story about a woman       who was miserable with her life circumstances, to the point that     she no longer wanted to continue living.  Rabbi Milstein told us        to imagine that the woman was blind, in addition to all the other problems that she was experiencing.  What if she could get her sight back?  Wouldn’t she be the happiest woman in the world?  We can all be the happiest people, if we learn to appreciate all the gifts we have been given.  When Rabbi Milstein spoke about this, it made    me realize how many things there are in my life that I never took    the time to think about.  This is just one of the experiences in Bnos Yaakov that changed my life for the better, and I feel very lucky that I still have time to gain from the many gifts my school has to offer.

                                    Imagine a small blue pebble among fields of blue pebbles.   As time goes by, the pebbles get blown, thrown, or kicked away;  and before you it the small pebble is in a completely new place.       As the blue pebble moves slowly with the wind a loud whipping sound is heard, and remarkably, all the original blue pebbles are moving with the small pebble alongside the wind. </br>
                                    What is high school? </br>
                                    As much as I’d like to say it’s getting up at seven to spend eight hours taking notes, tests and quizzes, I can’t.  Because in Bnos Yaakov, I’ve learnt that it’s so much more.  It’s the opportunity to    let ourselves grow and discover who we are, and within that    process we get to make extraordinary friends who’ve become like family, and have our backs throughout the entire journey.  I used     to believe that acing every subject and getting perfect scores is what mattered most, but Boruch Hashem I’m coming to understand that doing well academically is only a part of the big picture.  It’s about being able to look back at the four year experience and seeing the growth and progress we’ve been strong enough to build.  It’s to    look back and remember the inspiring lessons taught by teachers   that gave us one million percent.</br> 
                                    Lastly and most importantly, it’s having and keeping the incredible friendships  that we’ve been fortunate enough to make.    Like the small blue pebble, no matter how far each of our lives takes us, we will always hold on to the love and warmth that we’ve received from Bnos Yaakov, and it will travel alongside us forever.

                                    Splendor is growing</br>
                                    A faraway island, shaded pencil gray</br>
                                    An inspiring precept, filling hearts with sunshine yellow warmth</br>
                                    A poem, a piece of mastery, black on white</br>
                                    A project, the culmination of hard work and diligence, is a colored-paper rainbow</br>
                                    Growing stronger, larger, more brilliant</br>
                                    On colorful, bright walls</br>
                                    Are colorful, bright papers</br>
                                    Are pieces of hearts and souls and memories</br>
                                    Is a majesty of color
